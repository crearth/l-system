# l-system
Assignment Informatica Werktuigen (academic year 2021-2022).

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crearth/l-system.git
```

Configure a python virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
```bash
python3 -m venv l-venv
```

Use the virtual environment.
```bash
source l-venv/bin/activate
```

Install the packages via pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the tkinter package.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Use
Run the main.py file. It will ask you wich configuration file it should use and how many iterations you want. You can find some example configuration files in this repository.

### Configuration file
When you run the main.py file, the program will aks for a configuration file. The configuration file has to be a json file. There is an example.json file in this repository. These are the supported translations:
* angle: turn left
* draw: draw a line
* forward: move forward without drawing a line
* nop: do nothing
* push: push the current drawing state on the stack
* pop: replace the current drawing state with the one on top of the stack
* color: change the color from this point to the given name

with every translation, there is a value or variable:
* angle: amount of degrees
* draw: amount of pixels
* forward: amount of pixels
* nop: value doesn't matter
* push: value doesn't matter
* pop: value doens't matter
* color: name of the color you want, without capitals

### History
A history.txt file will be created in the directory 'logs' when running the main.py for the first time. Every time you run the program, a new line will be added with the configuration information and timestamp.  

### History backups
If you wish, you can make backups on a hourly rate with the bash script `backup.sh`. Add the following to your crontab (command crontab -e):
```bash
0 * * * * cd /path/to/the/project/ && ./backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
``` 

### Exporting the drawing
Currently, only .eps files are supported.
You can export the drawed l-system with the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py --export <filename>
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want, followed by the extension .eps.

### Web server
You can view the information and a picture of your latest drawing with the following commands:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=webPage
flask run
```
Access the webpage with this url: `http://localhost:5000/index`.

### Docker
You can build a docker image and run a docker container with the project files.
Important: in order for docker to show you the drawing, you should first run the following commands:
LINUX
```bash
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils

xhost +
```
MACOS (thanks to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cschiewek/246a244ba23da8b9f0e7b11a68bf3285))
1. install [XQuartz](https://xquartz.org)
2. launch XQuartz, under the XQuartz menu, select Preferences
3. go to security tab and ensure "allow connections from network clients" is checked
4. run the following commands
```bash
xhost + ${hostname}
export HOSTNAME='your_hostname.local'
```
Then you can start with docker:
```bash
cd /path/to/project

docker build -t l-system:0.1

docker run --rm -ti -p 5000:5000 \
		    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
                    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
		    l-system:0.1
```
On macOS you should change $DISPLAY to ${HOSTNAME}:0
Now you can run the main.py file.
